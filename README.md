## 🚀 WiseRise - A Smart Alarm Clock Project by :  Tala Zoabi & Maher Bitar
  
## 📌 Details about the project
**WiseRise** is an advanced smart alarm clock designed to improve productivity and efficiency. It integrates an Arduino-based ESP32 microcontroller and a Flutter-based Android app, which communicates seamlessly to manage tasks, set alarms, and sync with Google Calendar.

## 🌟 Features
- ⏰ **Personalized Alarm Experience**  
   WiseRise allows users to set custom alarms for specific dates and times, ensuring they never miss an important event. The system also features a **🌅 gradual wake-up light**, creating a more natural waking experience. Additionally, users can **😴 snooze** alarms for a few extra minutes or choose from a variety of **🎵 ringtones**, adding a personal touch to the wake-up process. 

- 📅 **Task Management and Integration**  
   One of the standout features of WiseRise is its integration with **📆 Google Calendar**, providing real-time reminders throughout the day. In addition to calendar events, users can receive **🔊 voice reminders** for upcoming tasks, making it easier to stay on top of their schedule throughout the day. This feature also includes **📝 manual task input** for users who prefer to add tasks themselves.

- ⚙️ **Settings Control and User Interface**  
   The **🛠 Settings Control** system allows users to customize their experience by adjusting various features of the alarm clock. Users can control the **💡 screen brightness** manually or enable **🌞 auto-brightness**, which adjusts based on ambient light in the room. The system also lets users control the **🔊 alarm volume**, set whether to **⏳ show seconds** in the time display, choose the **🌍 language** for the interface, and select their preferred **🎶 ringtone** for the alarm. This level of customization ensures the user experience is tailored to individual preferences. Additionally, the system supports **📴 offline functionality**, ensuring that the alarm will still work even without an active internet connection.

- 🎛 **Button and Physical Control**  
   Physical buttons on the device provide users with convenient control over essential functions. Buttons allow for easy **😴 snooze** activation, **🔕 alarm dismissal**, and toggling between different display modes. Users can also press a button to hear a **📢 summary of their tasks** for the day or manually toggle through the different screen displays. The **🎚️ button control** allows for a hands-on experience, perfect for users who prefer tactile interactions rather than relying on touchscreens.
